# Roaming-Jets-for-dog-fights
This is a drop and play pbo for exile servers that spawns in roaming jets. Advise to unpbo and change the config.sqf to your liking then repbo and drop in ExileServer\addons folder. If you do not change the map name in config.sqf than your jets will have waypoints that go way off the map. These jets only target other jets they do not target helicopters. Planes that cannot fight jets are Blacklisted in config to be ignored by the AI jets. You can add to the Blacklist if you have planes you don't want the AI jets attacking. Jets do not attack ground units. There is also a % chance setting for a loot crate to spawn on exposion of AI jet that is shot and destroyed and will parachute to ground displaying chordinates in chat channel. These chordinates are as it spawns so they change slightly as it falls to ground but that makes players have to hunt them and not find them so easily.
